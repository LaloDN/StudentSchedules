Hi fellas, it's been a while, this was a personal project that I started when I was a computer science last year student, I used to be interested in the backend development, but I was also interested in the data science, in february 2024 I moved from my Jr. developer job position to data science practitioner, then I started to be more involved in this field, and as a result I stoped all my backend projects, I have decided to pause this project indefinitely, no promises but maybe some day I'll retake this project, for now this project will remain as a API CRUD for my portfolio. Make sure to visit my other projects!

Best wishes âœ¨.

Hello there! It's been one year since I started this personal project, I have been busy with my last semester of bachelor and my new full time job, this repo has been gathering dust, but eventually I want to complete this project (at least the base project), finally I have completed the first phase of the project: the database creation and the basic CRUD operations, from now, i'm going to add an insteresing features, you can check the upcoming updates here:

## Phase 1 : First steps
*Status: DONE*

In this phase I'll define the database tables and create in Python all the modules for the DB record manipulation.

## Phase 2: Utility endpoints
*Status: In progress*

*Estimated completion date: Jan 2024*

The endpoints from this phase will be designed for specific tasks, this are more real world oriented operations like "Get all the students from X semester", "Top 10 students by their GPA", "Get the full school history from one student", "All the subjects of one teacher", etc.

## Phase 3: Security and roles
*Status: Pending*

*Estimated completion date: Feb 2024*

At the end of the phase 2 all the endpoints will be finished, after that my puropose is adding a security layer to the project, and protect all the endpoints based on a role system using JWT.

## Phase 4: Finishg phase
*Status: Pending*

*Estimated completion date: Feb 2024*

In this phase i'm doing all the final arrangements like: including Docker support, make a full project documentation, generate dummy data for the database dump, export some Postman collection with examples of the requests, etc. After this phase the base project will be done.



# Post project
This is some possible improvements that can be added to the base project, all this changes there are not subject to assured implementation.

## Phase 5: Applying DAO Pattern
*Status and date: TBA*

When I started this project I didn't have any idea of this design pattern, I have already implemented it in some real projects in my job and I like how beautiful and structured the code becames after this pattern, although this will be a heavy update.


## Phase 6: Frontend
*Status and date: TBA*

I would like to create a little frontend application to enhance the project, but to be honest I'm more a backend guy and I have another personal project ideas that I want to work on it.
